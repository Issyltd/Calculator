Completed: 24/09/22

## What is This Project?
It is a very basic calculator application I built using React. 
&nbsp;

## Issues I Encountered
I had a difficult time trying to downgrade my version of node which is why I was unable to download 'react-textfit' file thing.

This caused an issue with the way the numbers were being displayed.

I took an extra hour just to research more into css and I think it came out quite good.
